Modules provide an easy way to organize components into a system by serving as self-contained packages of variables known as namespace.

## How dit it works
1.find it
>Python must locate the module file referenced by an import statement.

2.Compile it(maybe)
>After finding a source code file that matches an import statement by traversing the module search path, Python next compiles it to byte code, if necessary.

3.Run it
