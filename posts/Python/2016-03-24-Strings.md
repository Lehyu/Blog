Python strings are categorized as immutable sequences, meaning that the characters they contain have a left-to-right positional order, and that they cannot be changed in-place.

## String Literals
By and large, strings are fairly easy to use in Python. Perhaps the most complicated thing about them is that there are so many ways to write them in your code:

{%highlight Python%}
'Spa"m'            #Single quotes
 "Spa'm"           #Double quotes
 r"C:\new\text.txt"    #Raw String
 u'eggs\u0020spam'     #Unicode strings
{%endhighlight%}

## Strings in Action

### Basic Operations

{%highlight Python%}
len('abc')           #3
'abc'+'def'          #concatenation
'good'*4             #Repetition

'a' in 'abc'         #Ture
'd' in 'abc'         #False
{%endhighlight%}

### Indexing and Slicing

{%highlight Python%}
S = 'apple'
S[0], S[-2]          #'a','l'
# S[start:end]

{%endhighlight%}

S[start:end] extracts contiguous sections of a sequence, and the end bound is noninclusive. Slice boundaries default to 0 and the sequence length, if omitted.

#### Extended slicing: the third limit

{%highlight Python%}
S = 'abcdefghijklmnop'
print S[1:10:2]        #bdfhj
print S[::2]           #acefikmo

L = 'hello'
print L[::-1]          #olleh
{%endhighlight%}

The third argument is known as step.

### String Conversion Tools

{%highlight Python%}
"42" +1           #error
int("42")         #42, convert string to int
str(42)           #'42', convert int to string
repr(42)          #'42', convert object to string
{%endhighlight%}

### Changing Strings

{%highlight Python%}
S = 'apple'
S[0] = 'X'            #error
S = S+' good'
S = S[:4]+'Burger'+S[-1]
S = S.replace('a','A')
{%endhighlight%}
