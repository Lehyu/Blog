* Adding Document Structure with HTML5’s New Elements
** header
Is used to contain the headline(s) for a page and/or section . It can also contain
supplemental information such as logos and navigational aids.
** footer
Contains information about a page and/or section , such as who wrote it, links to
related information, and copyright statements.
** nav
Contains the major navigation links for a page and, while not a requirement, is
often contained by header .
** aside
Contains information that is related to the surrounding content but also exists
independently, such as a sidebar or pull-quotes.
** section
The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead. A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline.
** article
Is used for self-contained content that could be consumed independently of the page as a whole, such as a blog entry.
** Modifying the Document Outline
You have a primary page title and tagline marked up with headings ( h1 and h2 , respec-tively), but you don’t want the tagline included in your document outline.
#+BEGIN_SRC HTML5
<hgroup>
<h1>HTML5, for Fun &amp; Profit</h1>
<h2>Tips, Tricks and Resources</h2>
</hgroup>
#+END_SRC
In this example, only /h1/(the largest headline of those headlines) will be shown on the Document Outline.
