## Overall
This project aims to provide a reusable Pull to Refresh widget for Android.

## How to Accomplish this Project?
1.Gesture Monitoring: In order to know whether user pull or not, gesture monitoring is necessary. This monitor includes the gesture's direction, sliding distance.

2.Custom View: Although we can accomplish this project by using Android View, but it may be too redundant, if we define our own custom view, we can have a good structured code.
